# Talking-Bot  

A speech chat-bot built with Python, utilizing Baidu Speech APIs for speech recognition and synthesis and Turing Robot API for backend processing.

To use this code, please follow these steps:
* Sign up for Baidu Speech API and Turing Robot API, create a project and get your own APP_ID, API_KEY, SECRET_ID etc.
* Fill the above information into the script 'Recorder6.py', since I have omitted mine. This information is necessary for user authentification and the API service. 
* Pip install necessary packages.
* Make sure you put the python script and the two button images under the same path.
* Make sure you have Internet connection and run the script 'Recorder6.py'
